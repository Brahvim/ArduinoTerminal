# "Arduino Terminal"!
A stupidly simple *thread blocking* terminal for the Arduino Uno!
(*...wish I knew how to make interrupts!*)

This was my literal first project on the Arduino, and also my first "feels like actual software development in C++" project! (Actually, NO.)

I hope to learn more tricks on C++ software development slowly! ;)...

..thanks to that friend I have IRL for finally getting me into electronics programming!
I hope to stay around for a while and *enjoy!~*

Thanks for readin', ":D!~
